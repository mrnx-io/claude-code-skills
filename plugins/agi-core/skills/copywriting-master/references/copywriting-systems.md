## Kennedy 28-Step Sales Letter System

**Axiom**: Preparation > Writing (80% upfront). Multi-step sequences outperform single shots by 2×.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Steps 1-5)

#### Step 1: Get Into the Customer

**10 Questions to Answer**:
1. What keeps them awake at night?
2. What are they afraid of?
3. What are they angry about? Who are they angry at?
4. What are their top 3 daily frustrations?
5. What trends affect their lives?
6. What do they secretly desire most?
7. What biases do they bring to decisions?
8. Who else sells to them? How?
9. Who are their heroes and enemies?
10. What language do they use?

**Theater Exercise**: Visualize receiving the letter. What would make YOU read it?

#### Step 2: Get Into the Offer

**Transform Features → Benefits**:
- Feature: 8GB RAM
- Benefit: Run multiple programs without slowdown
- Hidden Benefit: Never lose work to crashes again

Find the hidden benefit behind the benefit.

#### Step 3: Create Damaging Admission

Acknowledge flaws to build credibility.

**Example** (Italian restaurant):
> "We don't have tuxedo-clad waiters or fancy décor. What we do have is your grandmother's recipes, made fresh every morning."

**Formula**: Admit weakness → Pivot to strength → Turn liability into asset

#### Step 4: Think About Delivery

- First-class stamps over bulk
- Live stamps, not meter
- Intimidating outer envelope: "Important Documents Enclosed"
- Handwriting elements when possible

#### Step 5: Get It Opened

Personal envelope appearance. Promise on outside = promise inside.

**Warning**: Mismatch between envelope promise and content destroys trust permanently.

### Phase 2: Persuasion (Steps 6-14)

#### Step 6: Get It Read

**12 Headline Formulas**:

| # | Formula | Example |
|---|---------|---------|
| 1 | "Who Else Wants [Benefit]?" | "Who Else Wants to Retire 10 Years Early?" |
| 2 | "They Laughed When I [Action], But When I [Result]..." | "They Laughed When I Said I'd Quit. Then I Showed Them My Bank Statement." |
| 3 | "Do You Make These [#] Mistakes in [Area]?" | "Do You Make These 7 Mistakes in Email?" |
| 4 | "How to [Achieve Benefit]" | "How to Write Copy That Sells" |
| 5 | "The Secret of [Desired Outcome]" | "The Secret of Six-Figure Freelancers" |
| 6 | "Warning: [Danger] Could [Consequence]" | "Warning: This Mistake Could Cost Your Retirement" |
| 7 | "Give Me [Time] and I'll Give You [Result]" | "Give Me 30 Days and I'll Give You Abs" |

#### Step 7: Beat the Price Bugaboo

**5 Price Strategies**:

| Strategy | Mechanism | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Apples-Oranges** | Incomparable positioning | "Not a course—a transformation system" |
| **Bulk** | Per-unit reduction | "$997 for 12 months = $2.73/day" |
| **Development Cost** | R&D justification | "After 10 years and $2M in testing..." |
| **Parts > Whole** | Component stacking | "Module 1 alone is worth $500" |
| **Conceal Units** | Avoid per-item math | Total price only, no breakdown |

**3 Letter Formulas**:
1. **Problem-Agitation-Solution** (PAS): State problem → Twist knife → Offer relief
2. **Fortune Telling**: Project future with/without solution
3. **Winners/Losers**: Contrast two outcomes

#### Step 8: Review Techniques

| Technique | Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Intimidation** | Scarcity/qualification | "Only for serious applicants" |
| **Credibility** | Facts/statistics | "Verified by 3rd party audit" |
| **ROI** | Sells money at discount | "Make $10 for every $1 spent" |
| **Ego** | Modern/sophisticated | "For the discerning investor" |
| **Guarantee** | Risk reversal | 5 types below |

**5 Guarantee Types**:
1. **Basic**: Money back, no questions
2. **Keep Premium**: Refund but keep bonus
3. **Redundancy**: Double guarantee
4. **Trial**: Use then decide
5. **Focus**: Guarantee specific outcome

#### Step 9: First Draft

Write freely. No editing. Get it out.

#### Step 10: Strategic Rewrite

- **Double Path**: Impulsive skim vs. analytical deep read
- **Repetition**: 6 methods (direct, varied, examples, visuals, testimonials, summary)
- **Yes-Sequence**: Series of agreements leading to purchase
- **Page Teasers**: Mid-sentence page breaks → force turn

#### Step 11: Style Rewrite

- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Short sentences (vary rhythm)
- First paragraph = extended headline
- Entertaining, sensory, vivid words
- Personal voice ("I" and "you")

#### Step 12: Address Objections

**Proactive objection handling**:
1. List every reason NOT to buy
2. FAQ with answer + testimonial + guarantee for each
3. Raise objections BEFORE reader thinks them

#### Step 13: Incite Action

**7 Mañana Antidotes**:

| Antidote | Mechanism | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Limited Availability** | Scarcity | "Only 50 spots available" |
| **Premiums** | Bonus expiration | "Bonuses expire at midnight" |
| **Deadlines** | Time pressure | "Price rises Friday" |
| **Multiple Offers** | Different angles | "Choose your path" |
| **Discounts/Penalties** | Early bird vs. late | "$200 off before [date]" |
| **Sweepstakes** | Gamification | "Order now to enter drawing" |
| **Ease** | Friction removal | "1-click order, instant access" |

#### Step 14: P.S.

P.S. = Second headline. Readers skip to end.

**Uses**:
- Summarize main benefit
- Restate guarantee
- Add urgency
- Introduce bonus

### Phase 3: Refinement (Steps 15-28)

15. **Checklist**: Verify all techniques included
16. **Graphic Enhancement**: Bullets, bold, callouts
17. **Pretest**: Read aloud, show to customers, "child test"
18-28. **Rewrite → Layout → Mock-Up → Cool-Off → Opinions → Final Review → Print → Mail**

**Secret of Sequences**: Multi-step always beats single shot.

## Sugarman 23 Copy Elements

**Axiom**: Copy = Slippery Slide. Every sentence exists to get the next sentence read.

### Core Principle

Sentence n gets sentence n+1. First sentence pulls reader in. Momentum builds. Reader slides down like child on playground slide. Cannot stop until bottom (purchase).

### The 23 Elements

| # | Element | Purpose | Application |
|---|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Typeface** | Readability | Serif for body (5:1 comprehension) |
| 2 | **First Sentence** | Entry point | Short, simple, compelling |
| 3 | **Second Sentence** | Momentum | Continue the pull |
| 4 | **Paragraph Headings** | Scanners | Break text, tease sections |
| 5 | **Product Explanation** | Clarity | Match complexity to product |
| 6 | **New Features** | Differentiation | Highlight what's unique |
| 7 | **Technical Explanation** | Credibility | Include even if unread |
| 8 | **Anticipate Objections** | Preemption | Raise before reader thinks |
| 9 | **Resolve Objections** | Proof | Answer with evidence |
| 10 | **Gender** | Targeting | Tailor language to audience |
| 11 | **Clarity** | Understanding | No jargon, no clichés |
| 12 | **Rhythm** | Flow | Vary sentence lengths |
| 13 | **Service** | Confidence | Address repairs, support |
| 14 | **Physical Dimensions** | Concreteness | Always include specs |
| 15 | **Trial Period** | Risk reversal | Longer = fewer returns |
| 16 | **Price Comparison** | Value framing | Compare to expensive alternative |
| 17 | **Testimonials** | Social proof | Credible sources |
| 18 | **Price** | Presentation | Large if low, small if high |
| 19 | **Offer Summary** | Clarity | What they get for money |
| 20 | **Avoid Too Much** | Focus | Ruthless editing |
| 21 | **Ease of Ordering** | Friction | Dotted coupon lines |
| 22 | **Ask for Order** | CTA | Explicit close |
| 23 | **Graphic Elements** | Design | 10 total: headline → layout |

## Hypnotic Writing (Vitale 5-Step)

**Axiom**: Hypnosis = Focused Attention. Waking trance through stories.

Not evil (AMA-sanctioned). Does not remove choice.

### 5-Step Process

| Step | Name | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| 1 | **Intention** | Afformations: "Why do I have 100% response?" |
| 2 | **Research** | Immerse in product, customers, market |
| 3 | **Creation** | Self-Two flow (no critic, gibberish start if needed) |
| 4 | **Rewrite** | Self-One sharpens (cut heads and feet) |
| 5 | **Test** | Marketplace feedback, split tests |

### Story Power

Stories bypass defenses:
- Unresolved hook (open loop)

- Connotation > Denotation (implied emotional)

### 11 Creativity Practices

1. Act, don't gripe
2. Break rules deliberately
3. Change habits regularly
4. Build resilience to rejection
5. Explore dark corners
6. Maintain focus on outcome
7. Persist through blocks
8. Listen more than speak
