## 10 Direct Response Rules

Every dollar must return ≥2×. Math over magic.

### Rule 1: Always an Offer

Every piece must have a measurable offer:
- **Lead-gen**: Free info, consultation, audit
- **Direct**: Purchase, trial, signup
- **Hybrid**: Multiple offers (info kit + trial)

Threshold spectrum: Low (info kit) → High (free exam)

### Rule 2: Reason to Respond Now

Engineer urgency:
- **Scarcity**: Limited slots, inventory
- **Exclusivity**: "Only for qualified applicants"
- **Contextual**: Deadlines, seasonal
- **Structural**: Auctions, first-come

### Rule 3: Clear Instructions

Explicit CTA: "Click This Button Now"

Disney principle: Eliminate confusion to increase satisfaction.

### Rule 4: Track/Measure/Account

- **Target**: LTV:CAC ≥ 3:1
- **Deeper**: Ad #2 may win on LTV even if worse on immediate response
- **Tools**: Unique codes, surveys, pixel tracking

### Rule 5: No-Cost Brand-Building

Blind ads suppress response. Brand = byproduct of direct response. Un-brand for curiosity when needed.

### Rule 6: Follow-Up

The 5 "holes" where leads leak:
1. Unknown callers (who inquired?)
2. Trade shows (collected cards, never contacted)
3. Referrals (mentioned but not followed)
4. New customers (no onboarding sequence)
5. Lost clients (no reactivation)

Sequence: Re-state offer → Stern notice → Final → Change offer

### Rule 7: Strong Copy

Emotional/conversational, facts from customer psyche.

**Avoid 6 defaults**: Company focus, feature lists, jargon, passive voice, weak verbs, no story.

Mantra: "Timid salesmen have skinny kids."

### Rule 8: Mail-Order Format

Proven formats that sell:
- **Pictorial**: Image-heavy, aspirational
- **Advertorial**: Editorial disguise
- **Letter**: Personal, direct address

### Rule 9: Results Rule

- Test controls (split: headline/offer)
- Embrace "weird" (ugly > beautiful if +sales)
- Math over new fads

### Rule 10: Discipline

"Strict Diet": Purge junk, plan rules, track metrics, build muscle, avoid hazards.

## Value Ladder Architecture

Ascending commitment: low-risk entry → high-value loyalty.

```
Bait (Free/Low) → Frontend ($27-97) → Middle ($97-2k) → Backend (High-Ticket) → Continuity (Recurring)
     ↓                   ↓                  ↓                    ↓                    ↓
  Info Kit          Core Product      Webinar/Upsell      Application/Call        Subscription
Low Threshold      First Purchase      Monetization          Ascension           Stable Revenue
```

### Example: Dentist
- **Bait**: Free cleaning
- **Frontend**: Whitening ($200)
- **Middle**: Invisalign ($3,000)
- **Backend**: Implants ($15,000)

## 4 Money Model Offer Types

### 1. Attraction Offers (Acquire Leads)

High-value proposition to enter funnel:

| Play | Mechanism | Example |

| **Win Money Back** | Goal + compliance = refund | "Complete course or money back" |
| **Giveaways** | Partial scholarship/discount | "50% scholarship for first 20" |
| **Decoy** | Premium contrast makes standard attractive | $2000 / $500 / $200 options |
| **BOGO** | Perceived value > discount | "Buy 1, Get 1 Free" |
| **Pay Less Now** | Frictionless trial | "$1 for first month" |

### 2. Upsell Offers (Increase Transaction)

Next logical problem:

| Play | Mechanism | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Classic** | "X without Y" | "Lose weight without hunger" |
| **Menu** | Unselling/Prescription/AB | "Would you like fries with that?" |
| **Anchor** | High-price first | Show $10k first, then $2k |
| **Rollover** | Credit prior payment | "Your $97 applies to upgrade" |

### 3. Downsell Offers (Salvage Declines)

Change offer, not price:

| Process | Mechanism | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Payment Plans** | Spread cost | "3 payments of $333" |
| **Trial with Penalty** | Engagement incentive | "$1 trial, cancel anytime" |
| **Feature Downsells** | Value negotiation | "Just the course, no coaching" |

### 4. Continuity Offers (Maximize LTV)

Ongoing value for recurring:

| Play | Mechanism | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Continuity Bonus** | Free item for signup | "Join and get $500 toolkit free" |
| **Discount** | Free period for commitment | "First 2 months free with annual" |
| **Waived Fee** | Setup waiver | "No setup fee if you start today" |

## Grand Slam Offer Construction

### Value Equation

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

**Maximize numerator**:
- **Dream Outcome**: Ultimate transformation ("Retire in 5 years" > "Investment course")
- **Likelihood**: Proof, guarantees, testimonials, case studies

**Minimize denominator**:
- **Time Delay**: Speed to result ("Results in 30 days")
- **Effort**: Done-for-you ("We handle everything")

### Phase 1: Problems & Solutions

1. Define the Dream Outcome (transformation over commodity)
2. List all problems (before/during/after pains)
3. Convert each problem to addressable solution

### Phase 2: Trim & Stack

1. Brainstorm delivery vehicles (1:1, group, virtual, physical)
2. Apply criteria: High value / Low cost
3. Bundle into unique deliverable (incomparable)

### 5 Psychological Enhancers

| Enhancer | Target | Implementation |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Scarcity** | Delay | Limited seats, never-again bonuses |
| **Urgency** | Delay | Cohort deadlines, price increases |
| **Bonuses** | Dream | Tools/checklists > more training |
| **Guarantees** | Effort | Unconditional/conditional/anti/implied |
| **Naming** | All | Reason Why + Avatar + Goal + Time + Container |

**Naming Formula**: "[Adjective] [Avatar] [Goal] in [Timeframe] [Container]"
- Example: "Magnetic Marketing Mastery in 90 Days Toolkit"
