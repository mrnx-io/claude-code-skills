## Nine Secondary (Learned) Wants

Socially conditioned desires for rational justification. Always subordinate to LF8.

1. **To be informed** — Desire for knowledge ("Insider secrets")
2. **Curiosity** — Drive to explore unknowns ("Read this or die")
3. **Cleanliness** — Hygiene, orderliness ("Freshness you trust")
4. **Efficiency** — Time-saving, streamlined ("Automate in 3 clicks")
5. **Convenience** — Ease of access ("Free shipping")
6. **Dependability/quality** — Reliability ("Lasts longer")
7. **Beauty/style** — Aesthetic appeal ("Enhance your image")
8. **Economy/profit** — Cost savings, ROI ("$19.99" odd pricing)
9. **Bargains** — Perceived value ("Buy 1 Get 1 Free")

**Application**: Use Secondary Wants for WIIFM (What's In It For Me?) justification after LF8 hook.

### Cialdini's 6 Weapons (Expanded)

1. **Reciprocation** — Give first, ask later (door-in-face technique)
2. **Commitment** — Small yes leads to big yes (foot-in-door)
3. **Social Proof** — Others' actions guide decisions (Werther effect)
4. **Liking** — Similarity, attractiveness, association (halo effect)
5. **Authority** — Expert status commands compliance (Milgram: 66% max shock)
6. **Scarcity** — Limited = valuable (reactance theory)

## God Complex Mindset

3-part framework for charismatic influence in copy and positioning.

### Components

1. **Conviction** — Unshakable belief in mission
   - Effect: Natural charisma (feigned confidence fails)
   - Application: "I KNOW this works" → authentic power in copy

2. **Concern** — Suspend own needs; total attention on reader's hierarchy
   - Quote (Gurdjieff): "We received his total attention"
   - Effect: Seductive rapport — reader feels uniquely understood

3. **Focus** — Undeterred by approval-seeking
   - Emerson: "Power to annoy me I give them"
   - Effect: Retain control over importance granted — confidence signals value

### Unlosable Games

Redefine success broadly:
1. Acknowledge limits (can't persuade all)
2. Frame all outcomes as wins (rejection = intelligence gained)
3. Michener Principle: Assign meaning post-event (you control interpretation)

## 9 Needs-Based Framework

Emotional drivers that create bonds stronger than logic.

| Need | Definition | Copy Application | Effect |
|------|------------|------------------|--------|
| **Validation/Hope** | Encourage dreams at impasse | "Your instincts were right all along" | Associate → Inspiration |
| **Absolution** | Externalize failures (scapegoat) | "It's not your fault — it's the system" | Relief → Receptivity |
| **Security** | Allay fears (fear consumes bandwidth) | Evidence until fears subside | Undivided gratitude |
| **Confirmation** | Affirm suspicions ("I knew it") | "You suspected this for years" | Superiority surge → Instant ally |
| **Camaraderie** | Common enemy bonding | "Together against [enemy]" | Friend → Partner |
| **Significance** | Feel needed/unique | 6-step: Stakes → Role → Importance → Qualification → Sacrifice → Commit | Cult-level loyalty |
| **Agency** | Preserve choice | "The decision is yours" | Freedom → Deeper commitment |
| **Gnosis** | Secret knowledge allure | "What insiders know" | Irresistible curiosity |
| **Certainty** | Need to be right | Let them be right, add to it | Threat removed → Loyalty |

## 5 Gaslighting Strategies (Ethical Persuasion)

Doubt induction → reliance on persuader. Use ethically for positioning and authority.

1. **Repetitive Questioning** — Non-threatening repeat questions → doubt (pizza origin experiment)
2. **Pointing Out Invisible** — Highlight "obvious" misses → feel flawed → need guidance
3. **Alluding to Mysterious** — Jargon/esoterics → ignorance/dependence
4. **Revealing Secret Thoughts** — Claim insight into others' minds → wedge/trust
5. **Ganging Up** — Unanimous consensus → doubt senses (Asch conformity)

---

## Psychological Ventriloquism

Induce self-generated conclusions (undoubted) rather than "saying" (rejected).

**Method**: Create situations → reader concludes belief as their own

**Examples**:
- Lustig Eiffel Tower: Setup bribe scenario → mark concluded legitimacy
- Technical details convey expertise without claiming it
- Daisy Ad: Child + blast → owned fear of Goldwater (no mention)

## CMAD Process: 5-Step Contextual Architecture

Design belief lotteries through context.

1. **Define Proposal** — What needs satisfied (LF8)? What awareness stage? Success metric?
2. **Explore Context** — Pre-beliefs, hidden drivers, reception state (distracted/relaxed)
3. **Message Components** — 2-3 themes; choose mechanics (incongruity, scapegoating)
4. **Indirect Conveyance** — Stories/demos/ventriloquism (show, don't tell)
5. **Measure** — Test small-scale; iterate

---

## Application Protocol

When writing copy:

1. Identify primary LF8 driver (biological urgency)
2. Select supporting Secondary Want (rational justification)
3. Choose 2-3 cognitive biases for the piece
4. Adopt God Complex stance in voice
5. Address 2-3 Needs from framework
6. Apply ventriloquism: show, don't tell
7. Use CMAD to architect the context
