[HINT AT ANSWER / TRANSITION TO CONTENT]
```

### Full Example

```
On a beautiful late spring afternoon, twenty-five years ago, two young
men graduated from the same college.

They were very much alike, these two young men. Both had been better
than average students, both were personable and both—as young college
graduates are—were filled with ambitious dreams for the future.

Recently, these two men returned to college for their 25th reunion.

They were still very much alike. Both were happily married. Both had
three children. And both, it turned out, had gone to work for the same
Midwestern manufacturing company after graduation, and were still there.

But there was a difference. One of the men was manager of a small
department of that company. The other was its president.

What Made The Difference?

Have you ever wondered, as I have, what makes this kind of difference
in people's lives?

It isn't always native intelligence, or talent, or dedication. It isn't
that one person wants success and the other doesn't.

The difference lies in what each person knows—and how they use that
knowledge.

That's why I'm writing to you about The Wall Street Journal...
