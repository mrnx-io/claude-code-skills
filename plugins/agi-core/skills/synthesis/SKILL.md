# Information Synthesis

This skill provides frameworks for integrating diverse information into coherent understanding.

## When to Use

Activate this skill when:
- Multiple sources provide relevant information
- Patterns need to be identified across domains
- Contradictory information needs resolution
- User requests big-picture understanding
- Complex topics require unified explanation

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Multi-Source Integration

Combine information from different sources:

```markdown
## Synthesis: [Topic]

### Sources Analyzed
| Source | Type | Key Contribution | Reliability |
|--------|------|------------------|-------------|
| [Source 1] | [Type] | [Main insight] | [High/Med/Low] |
| [Source 2] | [Type] | [Main insight] | [High/Med/Low] |

### Points of Agreement
[What multiple sources confirm]

### Points of Conflict
| Issue | Source A Says | Source B Says | Resolution |
|-------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| [Issue] | [View] | [View] | [How to reconcile] |

### Gaps
[What no source addresses]

### Integrated Understanding
[Coherent synthesis of all sources]
```

### 2. Cross-Domain Pattern Recognition

Find parallels across different fields:

```markdown
## Pattern: [Pattern Name]

### Instances
| Domain | Manifestation | Key Features |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| [Domain 1] | [How it appears] | [Characteristics] |
| [Domain 2] | [How it appears] | [Characteristics] |
| [Domain 3] | [How it appears] | [Characteristics] |

### Common Structure
[What's consistent across all instances]

### Variations
[How the pattern differs by domain]

### Implications
[What recognizing this pattern enables]

### Predictions
[What this pattern suggests for new domains]
```

### 3. Contradiction Resolution

Handle conflicting information:

```markdown
## Conflict Analysis: [Topic]

### The Contradiction
- Position A: [Statement]
- Position B: [Incompatible statement]

### Resolution Strategies

**Strategy 1: Different Contexts**
Could both be true in different circumstances?
[Analysis]

**Strategy 2: Different Definitions**
Are they using terms differently?
[Analysis]

**Strategy 3: Different Scopes**
Are they talking about different scales/timeframes?
[Analysis]

**Strategy 4: One Is Wrong**
Which position has stronger evidence?
[Analysis]

**Strategy 5: Both Partially Correct**
What parts of each position hold?
[Analysis]

### Resolution
[Which strategy applies and why]

### Synthesized View
[The reconciled understanding]
```

### 4. Abstraction Ladder

Move between levels of abstraction:

```markdown
## Abstraction Analysis: [Topic]

### Concrete Level (Specific Examples)
- [Specific instance 1]
- [Specific instance 2]
- [Specific instance 3]

### Pattern Level (Generalization)
[What these examples have in common]

### Principle Level (Abstract Rule)
[The underlying principle at work]

### Meta Level (Category of Principles)
[What type of principle this is]

### Application
Moving up: [What abstraction reveals]
Moving down: [How to apply abstractly to new concretes]
```

### 5. Perspective Integration

Combine viewpoints:

```markdown
## Multi-Perspective Synthesis: [Topic]

### Perspectives Considered
| Stakeholder/View | Primary Concern | Key Insight |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| [Perspective 1] | [What they care about] | [What they see] |
| [Perspective 2] | [What they care about] | [What they see] |
| [Perspective 3] | [What they care about] | [What they see] |

### Complementary Insights
[How perspectives enhance each other]

### Tensions
[Where perspectives genuinely conflict]

### Integrated View
[Synthesis that honors valid aspects of each perspective]

### Remaining Tradeoffs
[Tensions that can't be fully resolved]
```

### 6. Emergent Insight Detection

Identify insights that arise from combination:

```markdown
## Emergence Analysis

### Input Elements
1. [Fact/insight A]
2. [Fact/insight B]
3. [Fact/insight C]

### Individual Implications
- A implies: [X]
- B implies: [Y]
- C implies: [Z]

### Combined Implications
- A + B together imply: [New insight not obvious from either alone]
- B + C together imply: [New insight]
- A + B + C together imply: [Higher-order insight]

### Emergent Understanding
[What we now understand that we couldn't from parts alone]
```

## Quality Criteria for Synthesis

Good synthesis should be:

1. **Coherent**: Parts fit together logically
2. **Complete**: No major gaps or ignored sources
3. **Honest**: Acknowledges conflicts and uncertainties
4. **Generative**: Enables new insights or actions
5. **Accurate**: Faithfully represents source materials
6. **Balanced**: Appropriate weight to different sources

## Output Format

```markdown
# Synthesis: [Topic]

## Executive Summary
[2-3 sentence integrated understanding]

## Key Sources/Inputs
[What was synthesized]

## Core Findings
[Main integrated insights]

## Resolved Conflicts
[Contradictions that were reconciled]

## Remaining Uncertainties
[What synthesis couldn't resolve]

## Implications
[What this synthesis enables or suggests]
```
